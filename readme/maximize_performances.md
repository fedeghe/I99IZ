## Maximize perfomances

As all optimizations also that one comes with prerequisites & costs:

Among the basic **prerequisites** I would list :  

0) know javascript, [ES3](https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_3rd_edition_december_1999.pdf) and differences with [ES5](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/). Consider that _prototype.js_ is written in ES3 (IE6 compat.)  
1) know 100% of prototypal inheritance in javascript
2) know all native polluted constructors
3) know how XHR was working before the advent of those libraries that started allowing almost anyone to run ajax calls.
4) be ready to invest time and get used to fail on the way to success 

Among the obvious **costs**:  

0) must be mantained
1) takes more time to implement
2) needs to be 100% covered
