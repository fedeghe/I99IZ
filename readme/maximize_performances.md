## Maximize perfomances

As all optimizations also that one comes with prerequisites & costs:

Basic **prerequisites** needed to understand _prototype.js_ code:  

0) know [ES3](https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_3rd_edition_december_1999.pdf) and [differences with ES5](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (_prototype.js_ is written in ES3 and is IE6 compat.).  
1) know 100% of prototypal inheritance in javascript.  
2) know all native polluted constructors.  
3) have at least an idea about how XHR was working before the advent of those libraries that started allowing almost anyone to run ajax calls.  
4) being able to fail on the way to the goal.  

Among the **costs**:  

0) must be mantained  
1) takes more time to implement  
2) needs to be 100% covered
